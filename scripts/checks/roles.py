"""The roles lane: canonical role definitions, assignment lenses, and adapters.

The roster is the set of ``.claude/agents/*.md`` files: adding a role is a one-file
operation. Each role's frontmatter follows Claude Code's published subagent schema, so
the files are ordinary subagent definitions and nothing in them is invented here.

Model and effort are the two variables worth tuning, and they live in exactly one place:
``.claude/agents/profiles.yaml``. Both clients' artifacts are generated from it — the
frontmatter block of each role file, and each ``.codex/agents/*.toml`` adapter — and this
lane rejects either one when it drifts. That is the only arrangement in which a profile
means the same thing on both clients: Claude resolves frontmatter *above* its
``CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`` environment variable, while Codex resolves its ``[agents]``
defaults above the agent file, so relying on each client's native knob would make one
switch override the roles and the other be overridden by them.

The role body below the frontmatter is canonical prose and is never rewritten; only the
frontmatter block is stamped.

``.claude/lenses/*.md`` holds the assignment lenses. A lens is one strategy a role can be
pointed at; it has no tools and no write surface of its own, so it is not a role and gets
no adapter. Both clients read a lens from disk at run time, which is what keeps a
four-strategy role from paying for all four on every invocation — and what keeps lenses
off both clients' `skills` fields, which do not mean the same thing. The link is checked
in both directions: a lens nobody declares and a declared lens that does not exist are
both errors.
