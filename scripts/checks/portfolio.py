"""The portfolio lane: what the search is doing, and the brief that scopes it.

The ledger says what is mathematically claimed. This lane says which routes are alive,
which are blocked and on what, which are duplicates of each other, and which families
have been worked out. None of that is mathematical truth, so none of it belongs in the
ledger — and the portfolio in turn never restates a statement: it points at a `cand:` id
or a node id and stops (CLAUDE.md constraint 11).

Every check here is structural. Whether two routes are *really* the same idea, and
whether a family is *really* exhausted, are synthesizer judgments; a validator that
guessed at them would be worse than one that admits it cannot.
