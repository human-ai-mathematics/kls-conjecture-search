"""The core lane: the claim graph, its manuscript anchors, and its bibliography.

identity and schema, the acyclic proof DAG, the separation of proof dependencies from
implication antecedents, the two classes of obstruction, and the coupling between a
node id and a ``\\label`` in ``modules/``. Proof certification lives in ``proofs.py``;
search activity lives in ``portfolio.py``; neither belongs here.

    skipped first; anything else means the environment has no title and ``None`` comes

    the character after it, so a literal ``\\[`` never opens a group.

    Returns the argument without its outer brackets. Normalizing it for display is
