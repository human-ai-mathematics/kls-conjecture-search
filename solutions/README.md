# solutions/ — the proof output plane

Where agents write **proofs** of the open targets: self-contained, standalone-compilable,
human-checkable `.tex` files — **separate from the manuscript** (`../modules/`). This is the
analytic-proof channel paired with the refinement and stress-testing work in `research/`.

A solution file is the artifact a newly `proved` ledger node points to (via its `solution:`
field). The ledger records the *claim and its state*; this directory holds the *proof an
independent reviewer or Lean can check*. Every newly `proved` node must carry a certified dossier;
narrative provenance and numerical artifacts are not alternatives to a checked proof. There is no historical
or inline-proof exception: every `status: proved` node must point to a certified dossier.

Definitions use the shared non-proof status `defined`; a ledger-worthy observation uses its
precise mathematical kind, while expository remarks remain prose. Externally imported results are
classified according to their actual role. Reclassification is not proof certification.

## Why separate from the manuscript

- **Human review boundary.** A reviewer reads one self-contained file and its one-file PDF, not
  a diff against the whole book.
- **Clear provenance.** Agent-authored, dated, revertible; lifting a checked solution into the
  manuscript remains an explicit project-owner decision.
- **Liftable.** Each file is a `subfiles` document, so once accepted it drops into `main.tex`
  with a single `\subfile{solutions/<id>}` line — no rewrite.

## Certification modes

A proof is only as trustworthy as its check. Every solution declares its level in the header:

| `checked_by` | meaning | ledger effect |
|---|---|---|
| `none`  | drafted, unreviewed dossier header only | **no ledger value** — not a proof yet |
| `agent` | a distinct agent audited the complete natural-language proof and left a persisted report | yes (agent-certified) |
| `human` | a human read and accepts the natural-language argument | yes (human-certified) |
| `lean`  | a compiling Lean proof sits beside it (`<id>.lean`) | yes (machine-certified) |

Agent certification is deliberately explicit rather than being recorded as human review. It
requires a repo-local `review:` report whose front matter names distinct author(s) and reviewer.
The report uses the structured contract in
[`../research/reviews/README.md`](../research/reviews/README.md): its immutable historical scope
must contain every current node and dossier pointing to it. The report body states the
mathematical findings, corrections, and exclusions. This gate was enabled by the project owner on
2026-08-21 for independently audited results.

Human certification requires a named ledger `accepted_by`. Lean certification requires the
adjacent `<solution-stem>.lean` file. A dossier may certify a conditional implication while the
node remains `status: conditional`; only discharge of its assumptions permits `status: proved`.

Numerics never appear on this ladder: they may guide intuition or suggest a counterexample, but
they do not validate a claim, justify a proof step, or certify a dossier. Every proof must stand
independently of numerical outcomes, as required by [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

## Writing a solution

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.tex` to `solutions/<ledger-id>.tex` (replace `:` with `-`). Closely coupled
   nodes may share one target-level dossier if its header and theorem labels enumerate every
   covered ledger id explicitly.
2. Fill the audit header (ledger node, `refines` label, `bounded_by`, `checked_by`, separate
   author/reviewer identities, review path, and date).
3. State the **refined** theorem and prove it. Use `\ref`/
   `\cite` freely — they resolve when lifted into `main.tex` and show `??` standalone (expected).
4. Compile standalone:
   ```bash
   cd solutions
   latexmk -pdf -outdir=../build <id>.tex
   ```
5. Wire the ledger node (`research/a-series/ledger.yaml` or `research/kls/ledger.yaml`): add
   `solution: solutions/<id>.tex` and `checked_by: agent|human|lean`. For an agent audit, also
   add `review`; for human acceptance add `accepted_by`. The node may flip to `status: proved`
   only once these artifacts exist and no unresolved premise remains. A reviewed conditional
   implication keeps `status: conditional` — enforced by `research/check_ledger.py`.

## Definition of done (a proof contribution)

1. `solutions/<id>.tex` exists, compiles standalone, audit header complete.
2. The theorem matches the refined statement in the manuscript `\label` it `refines`, and
   respects every `bounded_by` obstruction.
3. The ledger node has `solution:` + `checked_by` set; `python3 research/check_ledger.py`
   returns 0 errors.
4. `checked_by: agent` (independent named agent plus persisted report), `checked_by: human`
   (a named human accepted it), or `checked_by: lean` (with `<id>.lean`).
