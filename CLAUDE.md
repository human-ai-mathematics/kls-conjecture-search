# CLAUDE.md — repository contract

`AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file, so Claude Code and Codex receive the same instructions.
This is the root contract for work entering the repository, and it is normative: scoped
contracts — the [ledger](research/program/ledger-schema.md) and
[portfolio](research/program/portfolio-schema.md) schemas, [proofs](solutions/README.md),
[numerics](experiments/README.md), [role permissions](.claude/agents/README.md), the
[lenses](.claude/lenses/README.md) those roles load — may add narrower requirements and never
override this file.

Two documents are not contract and are worth reading once:
[`docs/RUNNING-A-SEARCH.md`](docs/RUNNING-A-SEARCH.md) is the operational path end to end,
and [`example/`](example/README.md) is one complete search of that shape. Use
[`research/README.md`](research/README.md) to locate each domain's source of truth.

Three words, three meanings, kept apart on purpose. A **domain** is one of the three things
the repository is organized into — mathematical state, search state, durable evidence; the
`README.md` table lists them. A **gate** is an optional layer the work activates, listed
below. A **lane** is an implementation partition of `scripts/check.py`, selected with
`--lane`. Nothing lines the three up, and nothing should.

## Scope

This is a harness for **sustained conjecture search**: proving or refuting one hard statement,
over many sessions and several agents at once, without losing what the search has learned.

It is deliberately not a general mathematical-research harness. Theory building,
classification, algorithm design, exposition, and computer-assisted proof with first-class
certificates are all outside what it is tuned for. Say so plainly rather than bending the
machinery, and add what a different mode needs as a new domain of its own.

The separation everything else follows from:

> Ledger = what is mathematically claimed. Portfolio = what the search is doing.
> Checkpoints = why the portfolio changed.

## The gates

Nothing here is a global mode flag. Each gate is activated by the work itself, and a gate
whose files are absent has no rules to obey — `python3 scripts/check.py` validates only what
exists. A fresh clone therefore passes `check` while `check.py ready` correctly reports it as
an uninstantiated template.

| gate | activate when | durable state |
|---|---|---|
| claim graph | a statement is precise, stable, and reusable | a manuscript statement and a ledger node |
| problem brief | a sustained search starts | target node, exact negation, completion criteria, edge cases, known traps |
| search portfolio | several routes, agents, or sessions are in flight | approach families, route states, blockers, saturation |
| checkpoint memory | a result will affect future search | dated records in `research/explorations/` |
| certification | a proof or refutation is claimed | a standalone dossier and an independent review |

The order is not arbitrary at the top. A sustained search opens with a target precise enough to
be a ledger node, because the brief and the portfolio both name one and must resolve to it; the
claim graph is therefore the first gate a search crosses, not a later one. A portfolio also
requires a brief, for the same reason in the other direction: several coordinated routes *are*
a sustained search. After that the gates are independent.

Numerics, literature import, and repository hygiene are capability packs on the same footing:
present when used, irrelevant when not. The three roles that drive them ship uninstalled in
[`packs/`](packs/README.md) — `python3 scripts/new.py role <pack>` installs one.

The [published site](docs/PUBLISHING-THE-SITE.md) is neither. A gate owns durable state and
a pack is a role; the site owns no state and is nobody's job — it is `check.py status` and
`check.py portfolio` rendered for a reader who will never open the YAML, derived at build
time and refusing to publish a tree that does not validate. Nothing in `scripts/check.py`
mentions it, and a repository that never publishes one is complete. What its existence does
add is constraint 12, which fences the inbox it opens.

An afternoon of speculative work may cross none of these and leave no repository artifact at
all. That is a correct outcome, not a gap. Something crosses a gate when it must survive the
session or coordinate someone else.

## Workflow

How a search is actually run, end to end, is [`docs/RUNNING-A-SEARCH.md`](docs/RUNNING-A-SEARCH.md),
and one complete worked instance of it is [`example/`](example/README.md). What follows is
only what is normative.

**Search contribution.** Read the problem brief and attack the target through the one lens
you were assigned. Record a checkpoint when the work is durable — the six triggers and the
validated front matter are in
[`research/explorations/README.md`](research/explorations/README.md). A statement not yet
stable enough for the manuscript is a **candidate** and goes in that checkpoint's
`candidates:` list and nowhere else (constraint 7). Return a `portfolio_delta` in your
handoff: the state your route is now in, and if blocked, the exact `cand:` id or node id plus
what would reopen it. The `synthesizer` applies it; you do not edit the portfolio.

**Mathematical contribution.** When a claim changes, update its manuscript statement and its
ledger state, provenance and edges together, and leave `python3 scripts/check.py` at 0
errors. A finding reusable enough to be cited elsewhere earns a ledger node and a manuscript
statement, not a second home in a side registry.

**Proof or refutation contribution.** Follow [`solutions/README.md`](solutions/README.md),
which owns the five steps. Two rules are this file's: an author never certifies their own
proof, and refuting takes the same channel rather than a shortcut — the details are
constraints 9 and 10.

**Harness or repository contribution.** Keep the live contract, documentation, checker, and
tests synchronized. When importing a template release, name its Git tag in the commit message.
Do not invent a mathematical attempt; harness work does not by itself change mathematical status.

## Hard constraints

These are the universal constraints. They are numbered, and durable research records cite the
numbers, so **do not renumber them** — a constraint that stops applying becomes `**Reserved.**`
and keeps its slot. Constraints specific to this repository's mathematics go in the next
section, numbered `P1, P2, …`, so that a fork can drop them without disturbing this list.

1. **A ledger is a single-file write-contention point.** This repository has exactly one program
   ledger, `research/program/ledger.yaml`. Funnel every ledger edit through one orchestrator.
   Role definitions may narrow write access; no spawned role writes the ledger.
2. **Numerical work must be public and reproducible.** All numerical experiments must be executed
   through the `numerics` harness into a provenance-stamped artifact. Numerical output certifies no
   claim, proof step, or dossier. Exact arithmetic or an analytic witness it emits remains a
   candidate until checked independently in the proof or refutation workflow.
3. **The research battery is shared.** Use `research/instances.md`. Anyone may propose
   an adversarial instance; only the `synthesizer` curates the registry. Passing a finite battery
   changes no claim or proof status.
4. **`check.py` is necessary, not sufficient.** A green check establishes structure only.
   Semantic agreement among manuscript, ledger, and dossier, and the correctness of a proof,
   require independent review.
5. **Respect established fences.** `bounded_by` may name only a proved obstruction. A statement
   violating one is wrong by construction. Put plausible but unproved method barriers in
   `heuristic_barriers`; they guide work but do not logically fence a claim.
6. **`research/explorations/` is append-only.** Add dated files; never
   rewrite or delete their history. A later record may declare an earlier one superseded —
   that changes which record to read first, and nothing else. This governs records of *this
   program's* search. The worked example under `example/` is a fixture, not history: it
   records no search anyone ran, and may be edited or deleted freely.
7. **A candidate statement is not a ledger node.** A tentative statement lives in
   the `candidates:` front matter of the checkpoint that proposed it, under a `cand:<slug>`
   id, and carries no manuscript anchor, no status, and no certification. It is killed by a
   later checkpoint naming it in `retires:`. Once it is precise, stable, and worth reusing or
   tracking on the research frontier, promote it, at which point it is subject to every
   constraint above.
   Promotion is **one act**, not a node addition with paperwork to follow: the manuscript
   `\label`, the ledger node, a `promotes:` entry in a checkpoint — which is what ends the
   candidate — and every portfolio blocker repointed at the node. Skipping the third step
   leaves the candidate live forever, which is one statement in two homes, which is what this
   constraint exists to prevent.
   `python3 scripts/check.py candidates` lists the live ones. There is no other place a
   statement may be written down. A verbatim quotation of a manuscript statement, marked as a
   copy, is not a second home — the problem brief may quote its target that way, and the
   `reviewer`'s `sync` lens checks that the copy still agrees. A ledger node's `summary:` is
   a gloss, not a home; the candidate's `statement:` is canonical, because nothing else holds
   that text.
8. **Truth and applicability are separate.** A proved implication remains `proved` when its
   antecedent is open. Put antecedents in `assumes`, conclusions in `implies`, and only claims
   actually used to prove the implication in `depends_on`. Never encode an antecedent as a proof
   dependency merely to make a conditional status propagate.
9. **Proof provenance is plural.** An internally proved node has one or more `proofs` records.
    Each record names its dossier and independent certification mode, so alternative proofs can
    coexist. A dossier may reuse certified dependency nodes instead of reproving them.
10. **Quantifiers govern refutation.** A refutation dossier must negate the exact quantified
    statement. A single witness refutes a universal claim; failure of a dimension-free or
    uniform constant generally requires a certified family with the relevant divergence. The
    refuter is an ordinary proved node: it appears in the target's `refuted_by` and never in
    its `depends_on`, which records facts a proof used and a refuted statement has none.
11. **The portfolio is search state, not mathematical state.** `research/program/portfolio.yaml`
    records what the search is doing — approach families, route objectives and states, blockers,
    saturation — and has one writer, the `synthesizer`. It never restates a claim: a blocker is
    named by its `cand:` id or ledger node id, and nothing is copied. A route's `objective` says
    what it tries, which is an intention and not a claim. Approach families and route states
    never enter the ledger, and a transient route never becomes a node. Saturation is a
    judgment that costs a synthesis checkpoint and a reopening condition; it is never inferred
    from attempt counts or elapsed time.
12. **Public contribution is an inbox, not state.** Anything arriving from outside the
    repository — an issue, a discussion, a comment, a vote, an uploaded argument — enters a
    public inbox and changes nothing by itself. It becomes a candidate, a route, a ledger
    node, a proof record or a status only by being triaged into the artifact that already
    holds that genre, through the role that owns it. Nothing outside the repository is
    citable state: a `blocker:` may not name an issue, a node may not cite a discussion,
    and no count of anything — comments, votes, reactions, contributors — moves a status.
    A proof from outside takes the same channel as any other, and its honest record is
    `proofs[].mode: human` with `accepted_by`, which is an attestation and not a review.

## Program constraints

Constraints that depend on this repository's mathematics. Use them for merge barriers — a
comparison exactly one agent may hold — and for anything a fork of this template would not
inherit. Same rule: numbered, cited, never renumbered.

P1. **Do not fan out across the trace-upgrade cluster.** `q:upgrade`, the high-rank part of
   `q:stein-weighted`, and `q:alignment` share one high-rank occupation difficulty, but
   `rem:trace-upgrade-unification` proves no equivalence between them, and
   `rem:gate-zero-trace-upgrade` records that `conj:gate-zero` is related without being known
   equivalent. One owner — the `synthesizer` — holds the comparison and propagates only proved
   implications. A partial result on one member is not a partial result on another.

P2. **An antecedent is discharged, never assumed away.** This schema has no `conditional`
   status: an implication whose antecedent is open is `proved`, with the antecedent in
   `assumes` (constraint 8). P2 adds what constraint 8 does not say. A *route target* is not
   closed while its antecedent is open, so such a node is never reported as progress on
   `conj:kls`; and emptying `assumes` requires the antecedent discharged for every
   certification mode in use, including Lean in the companion `kls-lean` formalization.

`check.py` never writes. Creation and generation belong to `python3 scripts/new.py`: its
scaffolds never overwrite hand-authored files, while `new.py agents` deliberately replaces
generated role frontmatter and adapters. It never touches the ledger (constraint 1).

`check` and `ready` answer different questions. A freshly cloned template passes `check` and
fails `ready`, and both are correct: activation is structural, so an unopened optional gate is
valid, while `ready` asks whether a search has something to aim at. Neither weakens the
other, and neither is `publish-ready`, which asks only about the manuscript's title, author
and abstract — publication details that block no mathematics.

`check.sh` distinguishes "all checks passed" from "all *available* checks passed" and names
what it skipped. Only PyYAML is required, declared in the root `pyproject.toml`.
