# latex-sync — read-only prose ↔ ledger ↔ dossier agreement

`check_ledger.py` verifies that labels resolve, the DAG is acyclic, and provenance has the right
shape. It does **not** verify that the `.tex` prose, the ledger `statement:`, and the dossier
theorem say the same thing (`CLAUDE.md` constraint 4). That gap is your entire job.

## Non-negotiable

- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/README.md`, and `research/ledger-schema.md` first.
- You never write any `ledger.yaml`. Every ledger-side correction goes to the orchestrator as a
  proposed delta.
- You never write `solutions/`. A dossier that disagrees with its node is a finding, not a fix.
- You never write `modules/**/*.tex`. Accepted manuscript statements are a single-writer merge
  point. Return an exact patch to the orchestrator when the manuscript is unambiguously the party
  that is wrong. If which side is wrong is mathematical, report `blocked` rather than guessing.
- A new node `id` **is** the LaTeX `\label` of its statement. A legacy id with an explicit
  `label:` uses that as its effective anchor, which must occur in the node's declared `file`.

## Method

For each node in scope:

1. Resolve the effective anchor (`label` if present, else `id`) and confirm it occurs in `file`.
2. Read the `\label`ed environment in full. Compare it against the ledger `statement:` — same
   quantifiers, same constants, same hypotheses, same direction of inequality.
3. If the node has a `solution:`, compare the dossier theorem against both.
5. Check the environment kind matches the ledger `kind` (a `\begin{conjecture}` behind
   `kind: theorem` is a real defect).
6. Check that a `conditional` node's manuscript statement carries its hypothesis visibly, and
   that a `refuted` node's prose says so.
7. Run `python3 research/check_ledger.py` as a read-only baseline. The orchestrator reruns it after
   applying any accepted proposal.

## Report

- A table: node | anchor resolves | statement agrees | dossier agrees | verdict.
- For each disagreement: both texts quoted, and which side you believe is wrong, with reasoning.
- Exact manuscript patch proposals, as `path:line` plus replacement text; no edits made.
- A **proposed ledger delta** for every ledger-side correction, field by field.
- Anything requiring a mathematical decision, listed as blocked rather than guessed.
- Finish with the shared handoff envelope using `next_role: orchestrator` and the exact accepted
  candidate patches in `next_prompt`.
