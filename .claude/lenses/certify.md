# Lens `certify` — the gate for `proofs[].mode: agent`

You were assigned this lens and no other. Read `.claude/agents/reviewer.md` for the shared
contract; everything below is what `certify` adds.

## What you must actually check

1. **Statement agreement.** The dossier theorem, the ledger `summary:`, and the manuscript
   statement at the `\label` the node `refines` must agree mathematically — not merely
   resolve. This is precisely what `check.py` cannot do (`CLAUDE.md` constraint 4).
2. **Barriers.** The proof must respect every hard `bounded_by` obstruction. Check advisory
   `heuristic_barriers` without treating them as established facts.
3. **Hypothesis accounting.** List every hypothesis actually used. Flag any used but unstated,
   and any stated but unused (the latter is a sharpening opportunity, not a defect).
4. **Dependency and applicability.** An open `depends_on` is a proof defect. An open `assumes`
   blocks application of a proved implication but does not downgrade its truth.
5. **Citation debt.** Every external result must be checked against its actual source and
   classified `published`, `preprint-reviewed`, or `preprint-unreviewed`. An unreviewed
   preprint remains `open`. If the source is unavailable with your declared tools, stop that
   part and hand an exact verification request to `literature-scout`; do not infer a pass.
6. **The steps.** Go through the argument line by line. Constants, quantifier order, domains,
   boundary conventions, and limit interchanges are where these proofs fail.
7. **Standalone build.** `cd solutions && latexmk -pdf -outdir=../build <id>.tex`.

## Certifying a refutation

A refuter is certified as an ordinary proof — it *is* one — plus one question the prove
case does not ask: **does this refuter negate the target's exact quantified statement?** A
single witness discharges a universal claim; a dimension-free or uniform constant generally
needs a certified family with the relevant divergence, and a witness for one dimension does
not touch it (`CLAUDE.md` constraint 10). Quote the target, quote the negation, and say
which of the two shapes the dossier supplies.

Certify the refuter node. The target's transition to `status: refuted` with `refuted_by` is
the orchestrator's act on the strength of your report, and it is a separate delta. The
refuter belongs in `refuted_by` only — never in the target's `depends_on`, which records
facts used in a proof the target does not have.

## Report additions

- A **proposed ledger delta**: one `proofs` record with `artifact`, `mode: agent`, and
  `review`, plus the logically correct status and relations. This delta exists only for a
  `type: proof-review` with `verdict: pass`; an audit proposes no certification.
- `outcome: complete` and `next_role: orchestrator` only for a passing proof review. For
  defects use `outcome: revise`, `next_role: researcher`, and put exhaustive file/line-specific
  repair instructions in `next_prompt`; the orchestrator passes them verbatim. Use `blocked`
  for unavailable sources or genuinely undecidable scope.
