# Lens `construct` — build the object

You were assigned this lens and no other. Read `.claude/agents/researcher.md` for the shared
contract; everything below is what `construct` adds.

## Method

Build the object: the extremal configuration, the counterexample family, the explicit
transport map, the certificate.

1. State exactly what it is **and what it is not**. A construction that nearly has the
   property is a different object from one that has it.
2. Give the verification that it has the claimed properties **analytically**. A construction
   whose properties are checked only numerically is a candidate, however convincing the
   numbers (`CLAUDE.md` constraint 2).
3. Say which node or candidate it settles, and in which direction. A family built to refute a
   uniform constant settles nothing until the relevant quantity is shown to diverge
   (`CLAUDE.md` constraint 10).
4. Give it in a normalization someone else can reuse. An object nobody can re-derive is a
   dead end with extra steps.

## Report additions

- The object in closed form, or the exact recipe that produces it.
- The property list, split into proved and unproved, with the analytic verification for each
  proved entry.
- Which node or candidate it settles, and what remains between it and that conclusion.
- If the verification is numerical only: say so plainly, name the run artifact, and record the
  object as a `cand:` candidate rather than a result.
