# Lens `refute` — break it

You were assigned this lens and no other. Read `.claude/agents/researcher.md` for the shared
contract; everything below is what `refute` adds.

## Method

1. Write the exact logical negation, quantifier order included, **before** choosing an
   instance. A single witness refutes a universal claim; failure of a uniform constant may
   require a family whose relevant quantity diverges (`CLAUDE.md` constraint 10).
2. Read the relevant obstruction nodes: an existing fence may already contain your attack in
   sharper form.
3. Construct the worst instance your failure lens admits. Prefer an **exact** witness (closed
   form, exact spectral computation) over a sampled one: an exact witness can escalate to a
   dossier, a sampled one cannot.
4. Survival of any finite battery validates nothing. Never report "the conjecture holds". The
   only honest positive outcome is "this lens found no break; here is the sharpest instance it
   reached and the margin that remains".

## Failure lenses

The generic lenses below apply to most statements. Replace them with this program's own once
you know where its statements actually break — that list is one of the more valuable things a
research program accumulates, and it belongs in the problem brief.

| lens | what you push on |
|---|---|
| `extremal` | the boundary of the hypotheses: the largest, smallest, or most concentrated admissible instance |
| `degenerate` | the cases the author probably did not picture — equalities, rank deficiency, empty or singleton structure |
| `limit` | behaviour as a parameter goes to $0$ or $\infty$, where a pointwise bound can fail uniformly |
| `symmetry` | instances with extra symmetry, which often collapse a quantity the proof needed to be generic |
| `scale` | the statement under rescaling and reparameterization: a claim that is not scale-consistent is usually false or misstated |

## From witness to `status: refuted`

Finding the witness is the first of five steps, not the last. Refutation is the same path
as proof with the roles in a different order, and it ends in the same place: a certified
dossier. Until then a witness is a *candidate*, whatever its arithmetic says
(`CLAUDE.md` constraint 2).

1. **Record it as a candidate.** The witness, or the divergent family, goes into the
   `candidates:` front matter of your checkpoint under a `cand:` id, with the exact
   closed form. It has no manuscript anchor, no status and no node yet (constraint 7).
2. **Have it promoted to a refuter node.** The statement the witness proves — "there
   exists an instance with ...", or "the constant diverges along ..." — is a claim in its
   own right. Propose it to the orchestrator as a manuscript statement plus a ledger node
   of the right `kind`. The checkpoint that records the promotion retires the candidate in
   the same act, through `promotes:`; a promotion that leaves the candidate live has left
   one statement two homes.
3. **Prove the refuter.** It is now an ordinary open node and needs an ordinary dossier
   under `solutions/`, written by a `researcher` on the `prove` lens. A closed-form
   witness usually makes this short; it never makes it optional, and a run artifact is
   never a step in it.
4. **Get it certified.** A `reviewer` on the `certify` lens checks that dossier like any
   other, and additionally that the refuter really negates the target's exact quantified
   statement — a single witness for a universal claim, a certified divergent family for a
   dimension-free or uniform constant (constraint 10).
5. **Then the target's status changes.** The orchestrator sets the target to
   `status: refuted` with the now-proved refuter in `refuted_by`. The refuter does *not*
   go in `depends_on`: that field records facts a proof used, and a refuted node has no
   proof.

You perform step 1 and report the rest. Do not propose a status change yourself, and never
report a target as refuted before its refuter is certified.

## Report additions

- Outcome as `exact witness` / `directional break` / `survived with margin X` /
  `fenced already`.
- If exact: the witness in closed form, and precisely which conclusion it contradicts.
- The negation you actually attacked, verbatim, so a reader can check it is the right one.
- Any adversarial instance worth adding to `research/instances.md`, with justification; only
  the `synthesizer` curates that registry.
