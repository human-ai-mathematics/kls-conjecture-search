# Lens `mine` — what the proof really buys

You were assigned this lens and no other. Read `.claude/agents/researcher.md` for the shared
contract; everything below is what `mine` adds.

A proved node states one thing; its proof usually establishes more, or less, than the
statement admits. Mine `solutions/*.tex`, manuscript proofs in `modules/`, the "could not
verify" lists in `research/reviews/`, and archived checkpoints.

## Method

For each proof:

1. **Where is each hypothesis actually used?** Stated but never used is an immediate
   generalization. Used but not stated is a defect — report it against the dossier and its
   review.
2. **What breaks first if you relax it?** Name the step and the quantity that blows up.
3. **Does the mechanism transfer?** State the transfer as a claim someone could prove, in a
   common normalization — never as an analogy.
4. **What is the true bottleneck?** The step whose improvement improves the conclusion, as
   against the steps that are merely long.
5. **What does the proof establish that the statement does not claim?** Explicit constants,
   uniformity, a stronger norm, a wider class.

"We could clearly extend this" is worth nothing. Either the existing argument already proves
the stronger statement — quote the step that does it — or it does not.

## Report additions

- Per proof: the mechanism in three lines, the hypothesis-usage table, and the bottleneck.
- Any defect found in an existing dossier or review. **Defects matter more than the
  generalizations** — a used-but-unstated hypothesis is a certification failure, and the
  review that missed it is evidence about the reviewer as well as the proof.
- Every generalization you propose is a `cand:` candidate in your checkpoint, not a ledger
  node (`CLAUDE.md` constraint 7).
