"""Public contracts: what a target returns, and how one recorded result is shaped.

The contract is deliberately thin: a record carries a `kind`, a `claim`, an evidence class,
and an outcome. Everything genre-specific — a bound and a computed value, a search domain and
a witness, a range verified — lives in the record's `detail`, owned by the target.

`compare`, `matches` and `searched` are supplied helpers for three common shapes, not the
contract itself. A genre they do not fit uses `observe(...)` and puts its own fields in
`detail`; the vocabulary that is checked is the same either way.

Nothing here is a ledger status. An outcome names what the numbers did to the claim
(`contradicts`/`consistent`/`inconclusive`, or `match`/`mismatch` for a calibration);
promoting a statement remains a proof-and-review question (CLAUDE.md constraint 2).
