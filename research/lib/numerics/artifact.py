"""Run a target and write its provenance-stamped JSONL artifact.

"Committed + seeded" is what makes a run reproducible, so every artifact carries a versioned
header recording the seed, the resolved configuration, and the environment, separately from the
derived summary. Artifacts are written with exclusive creation and never rewritten; a dated
exploration may cite one, but a run enters no claim node (CLAUDE.md constraint 2).
