# SPECIFICATION.md — repository contract

This file is the whole contract. No client loads it on its own, so every session that edits
the repository reads it first, and every agent file in [`.claude/agents/`](.claude/agents/)
and [`.codex/agents/`](.codex/agents/) tells its agent to. The two directories define the
same three roles, for Claude Code and for Codex: a change to a role is made in both.
[`example/`](example/README.md) is one complete search, worth reading once alongside it;
[`templates/`](templates/) holds an empty copy of each file genre.

## Scope

This is a harness for **sustained conjecture search**: proving or refuting one hard statement,
over many sessions and several agents at once, without losing what the search has learned.
Theory building, classification and computer-assisted proof are outside what it is tuned
for. The manuscript under `modules/` is what a mathematician reads: fixed statements in
prose written for a reader, brought up to date at milestones (*Manuscript*).

> Ledger = what is mathematically claimed. Portfolio = what the search is doing.
> Checkpoints = what the search learned.

## Principles

Everything below serves six ideas; when a case is not covered, decide by them.

- **Record what must survive; certify what changes a status.** Exploration is free: a quick
  computation, a guess, a witness checked by hand needs no file and no ceremony. What a
  later session or another agent will rely on is recorded; what moves a status is certified.
- **A status is earned, never predicted.** A claim becomes `proved` or `refuted` only through
  a certified proof or refutation — or, for an established result, its references.
  Numerical output, a green check, a finite battery or a count of failed attempts moves
  nothing.
- **Nobody certifies their own proof.** A proof counts once an independent review passes it
  or a named human accepts it — and only for the versions it saw: the dossier and every
  statement it was checked against are fingerprinted, and editing any of them lifts the
  certification.
- **One writer per file.** Only the orchestrator writes the ledger, the statements of the
  manuscript, the brief, the portfolio and the bibliography; only the `writer` writes the
  prose around the statements. Every other role returns exact edits for the orchestrator
  to apply.
- **Every statement has one home.** An established statement lives in the manuscript, a
  tentative one in the checkpoint that proposed it. Everything else points at it by id:
  the ledger, the brief and the portfolio never restate a claim. A status has one home
  too, the ledger: the manuscript displays it next to each statement, and its prose never
  states one.
- **The record is not rewritten.** Explorations and reviews are append-only; a correction is
  a new dated file that says what it corrects.

## Layout

| content | location | writer |
|---|---|---|
| canonical statements: the labelled `prf:` directives of the manuscript | `modules/*.md` | orchestrator |
| the manuscript's prose, its headings and its split into files | `modules/*.md`, `modules/` entries of `myst.yml` | `writer` |
| claim state and logical edges | `research/program/ledger.yaml` | orchestrator |
| target, negation, completion criteria, traps, neighbourhood | `research/program/brief.md` (optional) | orchestrator |
| routes and blockers | `research/program/portfolio.yaml` (optional) | orchestrator |
| bibliography | `references.bib` | orchestrator |
| checkpoints and candidate statements | `research/explorations/*.md` (append-only) | any role |
| computation scripts and their output | `research/runs/` | any role |
| shared computation code | `research/lib/` (optional) | any role |
| proof and refutation dossiers | `solutions/*.md` | `researcher` |
| independent reviews | `research/reviews/*.md` (append-only) | `reviewer` |
| the introduction to the full proofs | `proofs.md` | orchestrator |

The brief and the portfolio are optional. Create the brief when a sustained search starts,
and the portfolio with its first route: every route lives there, and nowhere else. The
checker validates only what exists, so a fresh clone is green. An afternoon of speculative work may leave no file at all: something
is recorded when it must survive the session or coordinate someone else.

## Workflow

```text
target statement + ledger node  →  brief  →  routes in the portfolio
      →  missions (a question, an expected result, a starting lens)
      →  checkpoints when something is learned  →  orchestrator's decision on the routes
      →  dossier + independent review  →  ledger transition
```

The **orchestrator** is the main session. It applies every proposed delta to the
files it writes, and checks afterwards: `uv run scripts/check.py --fast` after an
edit to research state, the full `uv run scripts/check.py` after a manuscript edit and
before any status change.

It also carries the search's scientific judgment. After the researchers report, it
decides which route to pursue and why, which to set aside and on what known obstacle, and
whether to reformulate the target or examine a neighbouring statement. It applies each
reply's route deltas, removes duplicate routes, and closes a route whose objective is
finished or abandoned — a judgment recorded in a checkpoint, never inferred from attempt
counts or elapsed time. One checkpoint may synthesize several small explorations; it keeps,
for each route set aside, the obstacle that stopped it, so the next agent does not rerun it.

**A mission** is a question and the result expected from it, not a node and a lens:

> Study the conjecture in dimension two. Look for the equality cases and decide whether the
> mechanism behind them can survive in arbitrary dimension. Report the obstacles and the
> formulations they suggest.

It names the target or route by id and a starting lens — `prove`, `refute`, `mine` or
`construct` — as a posture, not a boundary: the researcher may change direction when the
work calls for it, and says so first in its report, with the reason. A solved special
case, a useful reduction, an essential hypothesis identified or a precise obstacle is a
research result, and a mission may ask for one.

**Early critique.** An idea need not be finished to be attacked. A mission may hand a
researcher an uncertain reduction or a half-built argument: *find where it loses
information, and propose a case that shows it.* The critic is a different agent from the
idea's author; its answer goes in a checkpoint and carries no verdict. Certification stays
the reviewer's alone, on a stabilized dossier, before any move to `proved` or `refuted`.

**The target and its neighbourhood.** One target orients the search. The brief may list a
few neighbouring statements — nodes or candidates, by id — worth examining because they
bear on it: a special case, a weakening, a reformulation. A refuted target stays closed; a
corrected version is a new statement with a new id, and the checkpoint that proposes it
says which failure it answers.

A session is this loop:

1. Run `uv run scripts/check.py` and read its summary: the target, each route with its
   `next` test and the last checkpoint that names it, the live candidates, the draft
   dossiers, and any certification an edit has lifted.
2. Pick a route of the portfolio that is not blocked.
3. Launch a `researcher` on a mission for it: the question, the expected result, a
   starting lens, and the route and target by id.
4. Apply the handoff's `deltas`; act on `next` by passing it on verbatim.
5. When a dossier is ready, launch a fresh `reviewer` with the `certify` lens (see
   *Review* for what fresh means).
6. Apply its verdict — a `proofs` record on `pass`, its `next` to a researcher on
   `revise` — then run the full `check.py` again.
7. Decide what the replies teach: which route to pursue, which to set aside and why,
   whether to reformulate. When a route changed state or a candidate was born or ended,
   make sure a checkpoint says why, and that the route's `next` names the test that would
   move it now.
8. If a milestone was reached — a status changed, a route closed, a statement was added —
   launch a `writer` to bring the manuscript's prose up to date (*Manuscript*): name the
   milestone and the ids it concerns. Not every session: the prose follows milestones.
   Run `uv run scripts/check.py --statements` before and after; the two outputs must be
   identical, or the writer changed a statement and its edit is reverted.

A certification the full check reports as lifted — a dossier or a statement edited since it
was fingerprinted — goes back through step 5: a new review, or a new human acceptance.
Recomputing the fingerprints without reading again forges a review.

Stop when the target is settled, or when no route is left worth running.

| you want | role | starting lens |
|---|---|---|
| a proof attempt | `researcher` | `prove` |
| a counterexample hunt | `researcher` | `refute` |
| to learn what an existing proof really buys | `researcher` | `mine` |
| an object built to order | `researcher` | `construct` |
| an unfinished idea attacked early | `researcher` (not its author) | `refute` or `mine` |
| a dossier certified | `reviewer` | `certify` |
| manuscript/ledger/dossier/brief agreement audited | `reviewer` | `sync` |
| the manuscript's prose brought up to date | `writer` | — |

Each role ends its reply with this handoff, which the orchestrator acts on:

```yaml
files: [<repo-relative paths written or changed>]
deltas: [<exact edits to ledger, manuscript, brief, portfolio or bibliography>]
next: |
  <optional: complete instructions for the next assignment, passed on verbatim>
```

Every field is optional, and a reply is as long as its result: a small advance is a few
lines and an empty handoff. A reply with no `deltas` and no `next` asks nothing of the
orchestrator. `next` is an instruction, not a summary. Something that blocks you is one sentence in the report; a
route it blocks is a portfolio delta naming the exact `cand:` or node id — "this looks
hard" is not a blocker. Words such as "pass" or "done" in prose never control a
transition; only a review's `verdict` certifies.

## Formats

Write mathematics in LaTeX `$...$`. The manuscript and the dossiers are MyST Markdown: a
claim is a `prf:<kind>` directive carrying a `:label:`, and a cross-reference is
`[](#<label>)`. Dated records — checkpoints and reviews — are named
`<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`; the filename is their only date, and orders them.

### Ledger — `research/program/ledger.yaml`

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: conj:main
    status: open
```

The ledger holds only what the manuscript cannot: each claim's status and its edges. The
statement, its kind (the `prf:` directive) and its file are read from the manuscript.

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable id, and **the manuscript anchor**: `:label: <id>` in `modules/`. Required. |
| `status` | `open`, `proved`, `refuted`, or `defined` (for, and only for, a `prf:definition`). It records what is established, never what is expected. Required. |
| `depends_on` | Claims used in the proof — the acyclic proof DAG. A proved node may not inherit an open or refuted dependency, transitively. |
| `assumes` | Antecedents of a proved implication. Truth and applicability are separate: the implication stays `proved` while an antecedent is open, which `depends_on` would forbid. |
| `bounded_by` | Fences. A proved fence binds: a statement violating it is wrong by construction. An open one is a plausible method barrier: it guides work and fences nothing. |
| `references` | BibTeX keys in `references.bib`, making this a result imported from the literature. An *established* result needs no proof record to be `proved`; see *Imported results*. |
| `proofs` | Certification records; required for a proved node without `references`. |
| `refuted_by` | Proved refuters; required for, and only valid with, `status: refuted`. |

Relation fields are lists of node ids. An open question is a `prf:conjecture` in the
direction the search tries to establish. A fixed normalization — a sign, a scaling, which
constant absorbs what — is a `prf:definition` that every claim resting on it names in
`depends_on`; there is no separate notation file. The ledger holds no attempt history,
numerical output or search state.

**The anchor invariant.** Every labelled claim directive in `modules/` — `prf:theorem`,
`proposition`, `lemma`, `corollary`, `conjecture`, `assumption`, `definition` or `example` —
is exactly one ledger node. A label on a heading (`(sec:x)=`), an equation or a
`prf:remark` is structural and is not a node. The checker reads the manuscript through
`myst build --site`, so an unknown directive, an unresolved cross-reference, a duplicate
label and any MyST error are errors. It also fingerprints each claim: the SHA-256 of its
statement as MyST parsed it, blind to line wrapping, spacing, numbering, a cross-reference's
rendered text and the page its target lives on — a link to a section (`[](#sec:x)`) is one,
so renaming the heading lifts nothing — a proof nested in the claim, and the displayed
status. Its label and its file do not enter either, so moving a statement to another
module lifts nothing. Any other edit — a symbol, a word, a hypothesis, the kind,
the title — changes it.

### Brief — `research/program/brief.md`

Front matter `target: <node id>`. The body, copied from [`templates/brief.md`](templates/brief.md),
gives what an agent needs before attacking the target honestly: where the statement is vulnerable,
its exact negation, what counts as a complete proof and refutation, edge cases, traps and circular
reductions, the neighbouring statements worth examining (by id), and a budget policy that permits an
honest unresolved outcome. It never copies a statement, and it lists no route: routes live in the
portfolio. Rules specific to this program — say, a comparison only one agent may hold at a time — go
under its traps.

### Portfolio — `research/program/portfolio.yaml`

```yaml
approaches:
  - id: ap:transport-gluing
    objective: Glue local transport maps across the overlap into one global map.
    state: blocked                  # active | blocked | closed
    blocker: cand:transport-compatibility
    next: Test compatibility on two overlapping balls, where both maps are explicit.
```

Every route lives here, from the first one. A `blocked` route names its `blocker`:
a node id or a live candidate id. It reopens when the blocker is settled — the checker flags a route
whose blocker node is `proved` or `refuted`, or whose candidate is closed. Add `reopen_if` only when
something else would reopen it. `next`, optional, is the discriminating test the route would run
next — what a resumed session starts from; the summary prints it with the latest checkpoint
that names the route. `closed` means the objective is finished or abandoned; it says
nothing about the target, and a route never becomes a node. Once the target is settled, no route
stays `active`. Why a route changed state is in a checkpoint that names it.

### Checkpoint — `research/explorations/<date>-<slug>.md`

A checkpoint is the memory of what was learned. Write one when something must outlive the
session: a candidate born or ended, an observation worth keeping, a dead end the next agent
would repeat, a route changing state, a run someone may reuse. One checkpoint may cover
several small explorations. The body, copied from
[`templates/checkpoint.md`](templates/checkpoint.md), names nodes, routes and blockers by id
under four headings:

- **Question examined** — what the work tried to understand.
- **What we learned** — each item marked *established* (an argument written out, not
  certified), *observed* (computation or examples) or *intuition*.
- **What resists** — the precise obstacle, or the limit of the method.
- **Proposed next step** — the next action, and what it would decide.

An *established* result is not a certified one: no ledger node inherits it through
`depends_on`, and a dossier reproves it rather than citing it, until it becomes a node with
its own certified dossier. An observation — *this relaxation destroys the information about
the equality cases* — is kept as it is: a candidate is created only once a statement
precise enough to prove or refute emerges.

```yaml
---
artifacts: [research/runs/2026-09-02-sweep.jsonl]
candidates:
  - id: cand:key-bound
    statement: >-
      A precise statement someone could later prove or refute.
closes: [cand:old-guess]    # earlier candidates this one ends
---
```

Every field is optional. A **candidate** is a tentative statement: no manuscript anchor, no
status, no certification, and its `statement:` is the only copy. Candidate ids are unique
across the log and never a node id. `closes:` ends a candidate an earlier checkpoint
proposed — never the same one or a later one — because it died, or because it was
**promoted**: given a manuscript `:label:` and a ledger node, which the closing checkpoint
names. A statement ready to be a node on its first appearance — an exact witness, checked
by hand — skips the candidate stage and is proposed directly as a manuscript claim.

### Run — `research/runs/<date>-<slug>.py`

Exploratory computation is free: a `python -c`, a scratch script, a notebook, kept nowhere.
A computation becomes a **run** once something that must survive rests on it — a checkpoint
cites it, a route is chosen or closed because of it. A run is a committed, seeded script, run
with `uv run`, copied from [`templates/run.py`](templates/run.py). Its output lands next to it
as `<date>-<slug>.jsonl`, whose first line — written by the template's `provenance()` — holds the
seed, the parameters, the git commit, flagged `dirty` if the tree had uncommitted changes, and
the library versions; a checkpoint cites it under `artifacts:`. A run guides the choice of route
and suggests statements; it proves nothing. An exact witness it finds is checked by hand
before it becomes a claim, and the check, not the run, goes in the dossier.

Let the tooling grow only as the search needs it:

1. **A plain script**, standard library only.
2. **Dependencies declared in the script** (PEP 723), once it needs numpy or mpmath:
   `# /// script` / `# dependencies = ["numpy>=2", "mpmath"]` / `# ///` at its top.
3. **A package, `research/lib/`**, once two scripts share code: its own `pyproject.toml`
   and committed `uv.lock`, kept apart from the checker's, and unit tests — a bug in a
   shared oracle contaminates every run that used it. Scripts stay the entry points and
   import it; the lock at the recorded commit gives the library versions.

### Proof records and dossiers

A **dossier** is a standalone MyST page `solutions/<ledger-id>.md` (`:` replaced by `-`),
copied from [`templates/solution.md`](templates/solution.md). Its front matter carries
`ledger-node:` — the node id, or a list of ids — a `title`, and a `numbering` prefix so
that its statements read Theorem 3.1, Lemma 3.2, … (set it before the first review: any
later edit lifts the certification); never its own certification. It opens with an
**Overview**, the steps and what each contributes, and may fold a routine computation
into a `:class: dropdown` proof, still written in full. It states the theorem in a `prf:theorem`, possibly sharper than the
manuscript statement it cites, and proves it in a `prf:proof`; every step stands
analytically, and each step the author could not close is a `prf:remark` naming what
remains. It may cite certified nodes instead of reproving them; it never contains
numerical output.

```yaml
proofs:
  - artifact: solutions/thm-main.md
    review: research/reviews/2026-09-02-thm-main-review.md
  - artifact: solutions/thm-main-second-proof.md
    accepted_by: <human identity>
    fingerprints:                   # printed by: uv run scripts/check.py --fingerprint <dossier>
      solutions/thm-main-second-proof.md: <sha256>
      thm:main: <sha256>
```

A **proof record** names a dossier and exactly one of `review` — an independent review with
`verdict: pass` — or `accepted_by`, a named human's attestation, which carries its own
`fingerprints`. A node may carry several independent proofs. A dossier no `proofs[]` record
names is an uncertified draft; the summary lists it as one.

**Fingerprints** pin a certification to what it saw. They map the dossier's path to its
SHA-256, and each statement the proof is checked against to its fingerprint: the node's own,
every `depends_on` and `assumes`, and every target that names the node in `refuted_by`.
`uv run scripts/check.py --fingerprint <dossier>` prints exactly that block, from the tree as
it stands; run it on the version you read, just before recording the verdict. Once a
dossier or one of those statements changes, the certification lapses until a new review or
acceptance. A result imported on `references` alone has no fingerprint; its manuscript
statement is the `sync` lens's to check.

**Imported results.** A result is *established* when the field already relies on it:
published in a refereed venue, or an older preprint widely cited and used with no known
gap. Age alone is not the test — adoption is. An established result is `proved` on its
`references` alone. Any other preprint stays `open` until it takes the ordinary channel: a
dossier that states the result as this repository uses it and proves it by pointing at the
source (theorem and version), an independent review that checks both the source's proof
and that the stated result follows from it, and a `proofs` record. The checker cannot tell
the two cases apart; the reviewer's `sync` lens does.

**Refutation.** A target becomes `refuted` by naming, in `refuted_by`, a proved refuter
node — an ordinary claim with a manuscript statement, a dossier and an independent review.
That review also checks that the refuter negates the target's exact quantified statement:
one witness refutes a universal claim; the failure of a uniform or dimension-free constant
generally needs a certified divergent family. The refuter never enters the target's
`depends_on`, which records facts a proof used.

### Review — `research/reviews/<date>-<slug>.md`

```yaml
---
verdict: revise          # pass | revise
authors: [<proof author>]
reviewer: <independent reviewer>
fingerprints:            # the versions read: uv run scripts/check.py --fingerprint <dossier>
  solutions/thm-main.md: <sha256>
  thm:main: <sha256>
  lem:key-bound: <sha256>
---
```

**Independence is a fresh context, not a different name.** An agent reviewer is a
`reviewer` sub-agent launched without any conversation history — never a fork of the
session, never the session that wrote or directed the dossier — and given only repository
paths and the author's `next`. `authors` and `reviewer` record who wrote and who read: a
human's name, or an agent's role, model and date, such as
`reviewer, claude-opus-5-5, 2026-09-03`. The checker only verifies that `reviewer` differs
from every author, so these fields record independence; they never create it.

Only `pass` certifies, and only the versions it read: once a fingerprint no longer
matches, the checker drops the certification until a new review passes it. The body states **Findings**, **Corrections** (or "None") and
**Exclusions** — nearby claims not certified. A repaired proof gets a new report; if a later
review invalidates a passing one, the orchestrator removes the certification and both
reports stay.

### Manuscript — `modules/*.md`

The manuscript is the one text a reader reads: a mathematician who has never seen this
repository should understand the work from it alone. It is split in two by authority.

- **The statements are fixed.** The content of a labelled claim directive, its title
  argument included (`:::{prf:theorem} Title`), is the statement; the orchestrator writes
  it, and its `:label:` is its ledger id.
- **Everything else is prose**, the `writer`'s: headings, motivation, examples worked by
  hand, the idea of each proof, remarks, the order of sections and the split into files,
  with the matching `toc:` entries of `myst.yml`. It may be rewritten freely; the writer
  proposes a new or reworded statement as a delta, never edits one.

Four rules keep the two apart:

1. **A status is displayed, never written.** [`scripts/status.mjs`](scripts/status.mjs), a
   MyST plugin, reads the ledger at build time and shows each statement's status next to
   its title: *Not settled here* (the ledger's `open`: not established in this project,
   which says nothing of the literature), *Proved* (linking to its dossier), or *Refuted
   by* its refuter, then the statement's label. The prose points at a statement
   (`[](#conj:main)`) and never says it was proved, refuted or is open. No check sees
   this; the reviewer's `sync` lens does.
2. **A writer's pass changes no statement.** `check.py --statements` prints every
   statement with its fingerprint; the orchestrator runs it before and after, and the two
   outputs must match. Unlike a certification, it also guards an open conjecture.
3. **No harness vocabulary in displayed prose.** Fence, ledger, route, checkpoint,
   candidate, dossier: a reader does not need them. Notes for agents go in `%` comments,
   which MyST does not render.
4. **Computations are evidence, and say so.** A reported computation never reads as proof.

How the prose is written is in [`writer.md`](.claude/agents/writer.md).

**Full proofs.** The table of contents lists the manuscript, then `proofs.md` and the
dossiers under *Full proofs*; a proved statement links to its dossier. Only certified
dossiers are published: the `pages` workflow removes every draft (`check.py --drafts`)
before it checks and builds. Read locally, the table of contents shows the drafts too.

**Contributions.** A reader names a statement by the label displayed next to it. Once
`project.github` in `myst.yml` names the repository, the plugin adds links that open an
issue form of [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) with that label in its
`statement` field: *Idea* and *Counterexample* on an open statement, *Correction* on any
other. Conversation goes to GitHub Discussions, if the repository uses them: the forms of
[`.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/`](.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/) serve the categories
*Q&A*, *Ideas* and *Literature*, which are created by hand in the repository settings, as
is *Announcements*. An issue or a discussion moves nothing: the orchestrator turns what it
brings into a mission, a delta or a correction, and a named human's acceptance of a proof
is recorded as `accepted_by`.

**Publication is a human act.** A person reads the manuscript as a reader would before
dispatching the `pages` workflow by hand; no agent dispatches it. A green check says the
structure holds, never that the prose is well written or faithful.

## Verify

```bash
./scripts/check.sh                        # check.py, the worked example, and the unit tests
uv run scripts/check.py                   # full: manuscript included; before any status change
uv run scripts/check.py --fast            # research state only, no MyST build; seconds
uv run scripts/check.py --root example    # the worked example, kept green as a fixture
uv run scripts/check.py --fingerprint solutions/thm-main.md   # a certification's fingerprints
uv run scripts/check.py --drafts          # the draft dossiers, left out of the published site
uv run scripts/check.py --statements      # before and after a writer's pass: must not change
```

A green check establishes structure only. Whether manuscript, ledger and dossier say the
same thing, and whether a proof is correct, is the reviewer's job.

`check.py` prints each error as a `FAIL` line, then a summary: nodes by status, routes by
state with their `next` test and latest checkpoint, live candidates, draft dossiers and the
latest checkpoint. `--fast` skips the MyST build, and with it the manuscript anchors and the
statement fingerprints; dossier fingerprints are still compared. The full check writes
nothing the repository tracks; the MyST build lands in the gitignored `_build/`, and
concurrent checks of one tree take turns on it. It needs uv, which provisions PyYAML from
`pyproject.toml`, and MyST, pinned in `package.json` and installed with `npm ci`. CI runs
`check.sh` — the full check — on pull requests and on pushes to `main`; the `pages` workflow
removes the drafts, then runs the full check before it builds anything.

**Harness changes.** Keep this file, the checker, its tests, the templates and the example
in agreement, and add a line under `Unreleased` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Harness
work changes no mathematical status.
